## Build a heuristic models to make predictions

* Seattle is one of the rainiest places in the world. Even so, it is worth asking the question "Will it rain tomorrow?". Imagine you are headed to sleep at a hotel in downtown Seattle. The next day's activities are supposed to include walking around outside most of the day. You want to know if it will rain or not (you don't really care how much rain, just a simple yes or no will do), which will greatly impact what you choose to wear and carry around (like an umbrella). 

* Build a heuristic model to predict if it will rain tomorrow.
